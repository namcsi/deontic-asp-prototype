# Examples

Here we gather some example object programs, including more well
known example/paradoxes from the deontic logic literature, encoded
using our deontic input language.

To run one such example, use the something similar to the following
command:

`
clingo example.lp --output=reify | clingo - meta-deontic.lp 0
`
